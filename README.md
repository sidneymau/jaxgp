# JAXGP

Implementation of Gaussian processes using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Based off of example implementation: https://github.com/google/jax/blob/main/examples/gaussian_process_regression.py.

This is mostly intended for use in my own research.
For a more general-purpose implementation of Gaussian processes in JAX, see, e.g., [GPJax](https://gpjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
